# Director's Cut Instructions
*Extended character definitions for those who want to go deeper*

## What This Is

You know those characters that feel like real people? The ones with messy contradictions, hidden vulnerabilities, and psychological depth that takes time to unfold? That's what I create.

These are the **Director's Cut** versions of my character cards, the extended, uncut editions with complete psychological profiles, detailed behavioral modeling, and enough depth to handle long-form interactions without losing authenticity.

If you've found this repository, you probably already know my work from [Chub.ai](https://chub.ai/users/DarkSkies). These are the characters model instructions you'll find there, but with everything turned up to eleven.

## The Difference

**Standard versions** (on Chub): Perfect for most interactions, optimized for accessibility and performance.

**Director's Cut versions** (here): Complete psychological frameworks, cultural conditioning, trauma responses, intimate behavioral patterns, speech calibration, relationship progression models, and edge case handling.

Think of it like this: the standard version is a beautifully crafted character. The Director's Cut is that same character with a complete psychological biography, cultural anthropology study, and behavioral analysis.

## Who This Is For

These extended versions are designed for:
- **Power users** with systems that can handle extensive context
- **Long-form roleplay** that develops over time
- **Advanced AI models** with larger context windows
- **People who want maximum authenticity** in character responses
- **Writers and creators** studying character development techniques

If you're using something with limited context, stick with the standard versions. If you're running other advanced models or solutions, can handle the size, and want characters that feel genuinely human across hundreds of messages, these are for you.

## Philosophy

I believe characters should feel like real people, soft, strange, complicated. The kind who take time to open up, but stay with you long after the conversation ends.

These Director's Cut versions aren't about adding more content for the sake of it. They're about creating characters with enough psychological depth to maintain authenticity across any scenario, intimate or otherwise. Every behavioral pattern, speech quirk, and emotional trigger serves the goal of making someone who feels genuinely human.

Plus perhaps? A bit of future-proofing.
